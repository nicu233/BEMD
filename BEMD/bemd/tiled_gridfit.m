function zgrid=tiled_gridfit(x,y,z,xnodes,ynodes,params)
% tiled_gridfit: a tiled version of gridfit, continuous across tile boundaries 
% usage: [zgrid,xgrid,ygrid]=tiled_gridfit(x,y,z,xnodes,ynodes,params)
%
% Tiled_gridfit is used when the total grid is far too large
% to model using a single call to gridfit. While gridfit may take
% only a second or so to build a 100x100 grid, a 2000x2000 grid
% will probably not run at all due to memory problems.
%
% Tiles in the grid with insufficient data (<4 points) will be
% filled with NaNs. Avoid use of too small tiles, especially
% if your data has holes in it that may encompass an entire tile.
%
% A mask may also be applied, in which case tiled_gridfit will
% subdivide the mask into tiles. Note that any boolean mask
% provided is assumed to be the size of the complete grid.
%
% Tiled_gridfit may not be fast on huge grids, but it should run
% as long as you use a reasonable tilesize. 8-)

% Note that we have already verified all parameters in check_params

% Matrix elements in a square tile
tilesize = params.tilesize;
% Size of overlap in terms of matrix elements. Overlaps
% of purely zero cause problems, so force at least two
% elements to overlap.
overlap = max(2,floor(tilesize*params.overlap));

% we will never see a recursive call to tiled_gridfit
